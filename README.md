# Reddit-Comment-Nuker

This is a simple script that will "delete" your comments on Reddit. 

Said something stupid? Accidentally post private info? etc then this is for you. 

It is currently set to "delete" the most recent one thousand comments, but it is easily changed by modifying the `setLimit` variable. I say "delete", because it actually modifies each comment to a silly message. Editing your comment is the only way to get rid of the original message, if you just simply delete the comment it is still stored on the website.
